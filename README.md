Prompt: 
Can you write me some python code based around streamlit that presents a ui to upload files, and then summarizes the file content using an openai based llm rest api. Need support file types pdf, txt and json. I'm using python 3.11. My llm model is called "granite-3-8b-instruct" available at this REST API https://granite-3-8b-instruct-maas-apicast-production.apps.prod.rhoai.rh-aiservices-bu.com:443/v1 with API key <template>
